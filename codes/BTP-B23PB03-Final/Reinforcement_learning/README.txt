Reinforcement Learning Project
This folder contains MATLAB code and Simulink models for a reinforcement learning project. The primary script for running the project is model.mlx, which guides you through the steps to execute the reinforcement learning task. Additionally, if you want to run a separate Simulink model, use the provided model.slx file to observe the results.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

MATLAB installed on your computer.
Reinforcement Learning Toolbox installed. You can install it using the MATLAB Add-Ons menu.
Running the Project
Stepwise Execution with model.mlx
Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
Open the model.mlx file.
Execute the code cells step by step, following the instructions provided in the markdown cells. This will guide you through the reinforcement learning process and showcase the results.
Running Separate Simulink Model with model.slx
Ensure that the Reinforcement Learning Toolbox is installed in MATLAB.
Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
Open the model.slx file in Simulink.
Configure the model parameters as needed.
Run the simulation to observe the results of the reinforcement learning task.
Feel free to explore and modify the code and Simulink model to adapt the project to your specific requirements.
